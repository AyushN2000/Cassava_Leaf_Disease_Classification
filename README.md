# Cassava Leaf Disease Classification
The notebook is a solution to a competition hosted on kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/c/cassava-leaf-disease-classification. 

# Objective of competition
As the second-largest provider of carbohydrates in Africa, cassava is a key food security crop grown by smallholder farmers because it can withstand harsh conditions. At least 80% of household farms in Sub-Saharan Africa grow this starchy root, but viral diseases are major sources of poor yields. With the help of data science, it may be possible to identify common diseases so they can be treated.

Data labels consist of Cassava Bacterial Blight (CBB),Cassava Brown Streak Disease (CBSD),Cassava Green Mottle (CGM),Cassava Mosaic Disease (CMD), and Healthy.
